## : Calc Ya Later Update

Added four new functioning buttons to the calculator: A delete/backspace, a square root, a squared, and a pi button.  Unlike the AC button that clears the entire numeric entry, The delete button can remove any and all numbers individually entered by the user.
the square root button can calculate the square root of any number entered, the x^2 button can calculate the square of any number, and the pi button displays pi and completes any operation using pi, entered by the user.
